[Verso 1]
Deja que la vida brote
Donde menos te lo esperas
Deja que se abra camino
Y trepe como enredadera
Deja que me lleve el aire
Hacia un futuro nuevo
Deja que vuelva al origen
Y que desaparezca el miedo

[Estribillo]
Que empiece la parranda
El jaleo que me abraza (Olé, chiquilla)
Este compás que arrasa
Mi danza, mi danza, mi danza
El jaleo que me abraza
Mi danza, mi danza, mi danza, mi danza

[Verso 2]
Deja mis semillas brotar, brillar
Ya no soy como era
Abro la puerta de par en par
Cantaré hasta el día que me muera
Deja que me salgan alas
Déjame volar del nido
Deja que vuelva al origen
Y que desaparezca el miedo

[Estribillo]
Que empiece la parranda
El jaleo que me abraza (Olé, chiquilla)
Este compás que arrasa
Mi danza, mi danza, mi danza
El jaleo que me abraza
Mi danza, mi danza, mi danza

[Puente]
Quiero volver a ver
Mi piel bailando en el río
Déjame vivir sencilla
O vete por donde has venido

[Estribillo]
Que empiece la parranda
El jaleo que me abraza (Olé, chiquilla)
Este compás que arrasa
Mi danza, mi danza, mi danza
El jaleo que me abraza
Mi danza, mi danza, mi danza"
Zahara,MERICHANE,soyungalgo,"[Letra de ""MERICHANE""]

[Estrofa 1]
Yo estaba ahí cuando todos bailaban
Mojaban el dedo, se creían eternos
Yo estaba en el baño aguantando la puerta con mi espalda
Mientras les besaba la lengua
Yo estaba ahí en las oficinas de Universal
Tragando sermones sobre mi gran potencial
Yo estaba ahí abrazada a la taza del váter
Yo era incapaz de soltarla y ellos de mirarme

[Estrofa 2]
Yo estaba ahí en urgencias acariciando el límite
Necesitaba algo infalible
Yo estaba de rodillas pidiеndo perdón a vuestro Dios
Por no saber dеcirle que no

[Estribillo]
Yo-o-o-o
A-a-aún ahí y sin saber salir
Yo-o-o-o
A-a-aún ahí, sin saber salir
Y no logro huir

[Estrofa 3]
Yo estaba ahí cambiándole el nombre a mis amantes
En la lista de contactos
Yo estaba ahí dejándole las bragas usadas en el armario
Jodiéndole la vida a un extraño
Yo estaba en la otra habitación, escuchaba su respiración
Deseaba que no entrase
Yo estaba entre las sábanas ásperas del verano
Dejando de ser quién había soñado
[Estribillo]
Yo-o-o-o
A-a-aún ahí y sin saber salir
Y no logro sacarme de allí

[Estrofa 4]
Yo estaba ahí con las llaves en la mano
Acelerando el paso, fingiendo que hablaba con mi hermano
Yo estaba ahí dejándome hacer
Con tal de que acabase de una vez
Yo estaba ahí confesándome por haberme tocado
Creyendo que ese era el puto pecado
Yo estaba ahí metiéndome los dedos hasta el fondo
Queriendo vomitar las penas, la vida, el odio

[Estribillo]
Yo-o-o-o
A-a-aún ahí y sin saber salir
Yo-o-o-o
A-a-aún ahí, sin saber salir
Y no logro, no sé cómo sacarme de allí"
LOS NIKIS,Olaf el vikingo,toni085,"Todos en la tribu le tienen miedo
Olaf el vikingo es fro como el hielo
No hay nada, no hay nadie
Que detenga sus impulsos de barbarie
Come carne, carne cruda
Ruedan las cabezas en caso de duda
Habla con la boca llena
Y hace su ensalada con aceite de ballena
No existe el miedo para Olaf
No existe el miedo
No existe el miedo
Olaf el vikingo no tiene miedo
Nadie entra en su fiordo
Porque pronto se iran al fondo
Olaf no piensa, Olaf no escucha
Solo quiere empezar la lucha
Ya no quedan enemigos
Olaf el vikingo est muy aburrido
Ahora trabaja en la trata de blancas
Y pasa las tardes jugando a la petanca
No existe el miedo para Olaf
No existe el miedo
No existe el miedo
Olaf el vikingo no tiene miedo"

Why is it hard on my own though
Why am I not like her, a bit more so-so
Why must the curtains come down (Why must the curtains come down)
As often as now

In the end I wish to leave something special
Let them talk, as long as my name is on their lips
Call me misty
Mysterious

Why is it hard on my own though
Why am I not like her, a bit more so-so (as often as now)

Why is it hard on my own though
Why am I not like her, a bit more so-so (as often as now)
Why must the curtains come down, as often as now (Why must the curtains come down, as often as now, as often as now)

In thе end, I wish to be someonе better
Help me with this comparison
Call me misty

Why am I not like her (as often as now)

In the end, I wish to be something special
In the end, I wish to be so much better (so-so; as often as now)

What the fuck is in my cup? I don't even know

Muse,Algorithm,toni085,"[Verse 1]
Burn like a slave
Churn like a cog
We are caged in simulations
Algorithms evolve
Push us aside and render us obsolete

This means war

Reload, crash out

This means war

Plastic Bertrand,Ca plane pour moi,copia002,"[Verse 1]
Wham! Bam! My cat, Splash
Is rolling around on my bed
He swallowed his tongue as he drank all my whisky
As for me, I've hardly slept, I feel empty and reprimanded
I had to sleep in the gutter
Where I had a flash of inspiration
Ooh-ooh-ooh-ooh
In four colours

[Verse 2]
OK, let's go! One morning
A babe came round to my house
She looked like a cellophane doll with curly hair
She was wearing a plaster and had a hangover
She drank my beer in a large rubber glass
Ooh-ooh-ooh-ooh
Just like an Indian might do in his igloo

[Chorus]
It's all working out for me, it's all working out for me
It's all working out for me-me-me-me-me
It's all working out for me
Ooh-ooh-ooh-ooh
It's all working out for me
[Verse 3]
OK, let's go! That babe was such a bitch
What a vibration!
Coming on the doormat
Filed down, ruined, empty, but happy
""You are the King of the Divan!""
She says to me in passing
I am the King of the Divan

[Chorus]
It's all working out for me, it's all working out for me
It's all working out for me-me-me-me-me
It's all working out for me
Ooh-ooh-ooh-ooh
It's all working out for me

[Verse 4]
OK, let's go! Mind your own, keep your nose out
Don't harm my planet
Today's not the day the sky will fall down around my ears
Or that I will have to go without a drink
Ooh-ooh-ooh-ooh
It's all working out for me

[Verse 4]
OK, let's go! my baby upped and left
She walked out on me, it's a shitty situation
She broke everything, the sink, the bar
And she left me all alone
Like a total jerk
Stuck here faced with the aftermath
[Chorus]
It's all working out for me, it's all working out for me
It's all working out for me-me-me-me-me
It's all working out for me
Ooh-ooh-ooh-ooh
It's all working out for me
It's all working out for me, it's all working out for me
It's all working out for me-me-me-me-me
It's all working out for me"

[Intro: Nicki Minaj]
You might think you've peeped the scene
You haven't, the real one's far too mean
The watered-down one, the one you know
Was made up centuries ago
They made it sound all wack and corny
Yes, it's awful blasted boring
Twisted fictions, sick addiction
Well, gather 'round, children, zip it, listen

[Chorus: Justin Vernon & Teyana Taylor]
Can we get much higher? (So high)
Oh, oh, oh
Oh, oh, oh-oh, oh (Oh)
Can we get much higher? (So high)
Oh, oh, oh
Oh, oh, oh-oh, oh
Can we get much higher? (So high)
Oh, oh, oh
Oh, oh, oh-oh, oh (Oh)
Can we get much higher? (So high)
Oh, oh, oh
Oh, oh, oh-oh, oh
[Verse 1: Kanye West]
Yeah, yeah, yeah, yeah
I fantasized 'bout this back in Chicago
Mercy, mercy me, that Murciélago
That's me the first year that I blow
How you say broke in Spanish? Mi no hablo
Me drown sorrow in that Diablo
Me found bravery in my bravado
DJs need to listen to the models
You ain't got no fuckin' Yeezy in your Serato? (You ain't got no Yeezy, nigga?)
Stupid, but what the hell do I know?
I'm just a Chi-Town nigga with a Nas flow
And my chick in that new Phoebe Philo
So much head, I woke up to Sleepy Hollow

[Chorus: Justin Vernon & Teyana Taylor]
Can we get much higher?
Oh, oh, oh
Oh, oh, oh-oh, oh

[Verse 2: Kanye West]
Look like a fat booty Celine Dion
Sex is on fire, I'm the King of Leona Lewis
Beyond the truest
Hey, teacher, teacher, tell me how do you respond to students?
And refresh the page and restart the memory?
Re-spark the soul and rebuild the energy?
We stopped the ignorance, we killed the enemy
Sorry for the night demons that still visit me
The plan was to drink until the pain over
But what's worse, the pain or the hangover?
Fresh air, rollin' down the window
Too many Urkels on your team, that's why your wins low
Don't make me pull the toys out, huh
Don't make me pull the toys
And fire up the engines, huh
And then they make noise
[Chorus: Justin Vernon & Teyana Taylor]
Can we get much higher? (So high)
Oh, oh, oh
Oh, oh, oh-oh, oh

[Bridge: Justin Vernon & Kanye West]
At the mall, there was a seance
Just kids, no parents
Then the sky filled with herons
Saw the devil in a Chrysler LeBaron
And the hell, it wouldn't spare us
And the fires did declare us
But after that, took pills, kissed an heiress
And woke up back in Paris

[Chorus: Justin Vernon & Teyana Taylor]
Can we get much higher? (So high)
Oh, oh, oh
Oh, oh, oh-oh, oh, oh

[Chorus: Justin Vernon & Teyana Taylor]
Can we get much higher? (So high)
Oh, oh, oh
Oh, oh, oh-oh, oh (Oh)
Can we get much higher? (So high)
Oh, oh, oh
Oh, oh, oh-oh, oh
Can we get much higher? (So high)
Oh, oh, oh
Oh, oh, oh-oh, oh (Oh)
Can we get much higher? (So high)

[Verso 1]
Fui a la discoteca a ver si me conseguía una fresca
Got myself some rum
Cause where I'm from sometimes you need some
Me tomé mi trago y una princesa pasó por mi lado
La miré con ganas con esa carita de fama
Ella miró ""Oh sí"" Ella pasó ""Oh no""
Ella se volvió con una sonrisa
Tengo que bailar con esa muñequita
La invitó y puso brinca
Y enseguida quise jalarla pa' la pista
Y cuando llegué AY
Llegó el tiburón y con el se me fue

Okey, tanto, encontré otra chica que estaba mejor
Bailamos tres merengues de corrido y gozamos
Luego nos sentamos, ordenamos bebidas y conversamos
She look good, so of course I lied all my girls from the hood
Ella preguntó si tenía novia y yo dije no
Me quité el anillo, despacito me lo metí en el bolsillo
Vino un descarado y me dijo : ¡Jo!...¿Tú no eres casado?
Me quedé pasmado y enseguida se la llevó de mi lado

May my arms be the arms that you fall into

Through the minors and the majors, I will sing you like a song

Yes, I do
Well there's something I never told you about that night
What didn't you tell me?
While you were sitting in the back seat smoking a cigarette you thought was gonna be your last, I was falling deep, deeply in love with you, and I never told you 'til just now!

Way out in the water, see it swimmin'

Animals were hiding behind the rocks
Except the little fish
Bumped into me, I swear he was trying to talk to me, koi-koi

[Verso 1]
Desde pequeño quería ser beisbolista, no llegué
Así que aprendí a batear hits por encima de una pista
Volví a tomar alcohol en mi despacho
Escribo bien sobrio, pero escribo mejor borracho
Cuando caigo en depresión
Mis problemas se los cuento a la ventana del avión
El estrés me tiene enfermo, hace 10 año' que no duermo
El IRS me sigue investigando
Me estoy divorciando, pero no importa, yo sigo rimando
Cometo errores, pero hago lo que pueda
Aprendí a aterrizar sin ruedas, y
Aunque en la calle me reconocen
Ya ni mis amigo' me conocen
Estoy triste y me río
El concierto está lleno, pero yo estoy vacío
En la industria de la música todo es mentira
Mi hijo tiene que comer, así que sigo de gira
Solo me queda lo que tengo
No sé pa' dónde voy, pero sé de donde vengo
Me crié con Christopher, mi pana
Tiramo' piedra' juntos, rompimo' un par de ventana'
Corríamo' por la calle sin camiseta
En las parcela' de Trujillo, cuesta abajo en bicicleta
La bici encima del barro
Con un vaso de plástico en la goma pa' que suene como un carro
Recargábamos batería
Con malta india y pan con ajo, nadie no' detenía
Eramo' inseparable' hasta que un día
Lo mataron entre cuatro policía'
Mi alegría sigue rota
Se apagaron la' luce' en el parque de pelota'
[Estribillo]
Ya no queda casi nadie aquí
A veces ya no quiero estar aquí
Me siento solo aquí en el medio de la fiesta
Quiero estar en donde nadie me molesta
Quemar mi libreta, soltar mis maleta'
Quiero llamar al 755-0822, a ver quién contesta

[Verso 2]
Las pelea' con mi padrastro cuando perdía el control
Las resolvía con él viendo un partido de béisbol
Me invitó a palear un par de vece'
Me escapé de casa un par de vece'
Pero nunca faltó el alimento
Nos defendió con música tocando en casamiento'
A vece' al horno, a vece' de lata y microonda'
Compartíamos todo, la mesa era redonda
Clase media-baja, nunca fuimo' dueño'
El préstamo del banco se robaba nuestro' sueño'
La cuenta de ahorro vacía
Pero mami bailando flamenco nos alegraba el día
Dejó de actuar pa' cuidarno' a los cuatro'
Y nos convertimo' en su obra de teatro
Ella se puso nuestra' bota'
Y su vida fue de nuestro' logro' y nuestra' derrota'
Mi padrastro se fue con otros pece'
Nos mudamo' de la Calle 13
Me fui a buscar la suerte en un mar de paja'
Y mi vida entera la empaqué en una caja
En la universidad de arte me becaron
A la mitad de mis amigo' los mataron
Empecé a rapear de nuevo, empecé a creer de nuevo
Volví, saqué un disco, me comí el mundo de un mordisco
En Puerto Rico despidieron empleado'
Insulté al gobernador, quedó televisado
Censuraron cuatro año' de mi calendario
Abuela murió, no me vio tocar en el estadio
Dije to' lo que sentí, me quieren má' afuera que en mi propio paí'
Pero aunque mis cancione' las cante un alemán
Quiero que me entierren en el viejo San Juan
Puede que la tristeza la disimule
Pero estoy hecho de arroz con gandule'
Y me duele, no importa que el ron de la madrugada me consuele
Y desde adentro de la pulpa
Si la cagué, a mi paí' le dedico cuatro piso' de disculpa'

Y si me contestan, quiero decirles que quiero volver
Que quiero salir de este hotel y desaparecer
Y si me contestan, quiero decirles que quiero bajar el telón
Que a veces me sube la presión
Que tengo miedo que se caiga el avión
Que no me importan las gira', los disco', los Grammys
Y que en la Calle 11 quiero volver a ver el cometa Halley con mami
Quiero volver a cuando mis ventana' eran de sol
Y me despertaba el calor
A cuando me llamaban pa' jugar, a cuando rapeaba sin cobrar
Quiero sacar las carta' del pelota' del envase
Volver a robarme segunda base
En verano y navidade'
Limpiar la casa con mis hermano' escuchando a Rubén Blades
Quiero volver, ir al cine en la semana
Y llegar a la escuela de arte' en la mañana
Quiero quedarme allí, no quiero salir de allí
Quiero volver a cuando no me dejaban entrar

Quiero volver a sentir, a cuando no tenía que fingír
Yo quiero volver a ser yo

Do you ever desire a mother’s embrace
Well we offer them free for every client subscribing now
Remember the first time you ate candy
Check-in now the experience will be yours to keep

[Verse 2]
Remember how colours they felt so sweet
All you needed was your fantasy to enjoy your day
Go back to the age you could flee reality
We know that you’ve been longing for that feeling for a long time

[Bridge]
Our house throws you back in time to when you were a little child to escape for a while
No more stress no emptiness pure innocence and confidence like when you were just 5

[Chorus]
A single drop will raise your earliest memories
A single drop could be the quickest remedy
A single drop will raise your earliest memories
A single drop
A single drop will raise your earliest memories

The freedom of blissful ignorance and joy
Yes we know what you want and need come see us night or day
If you cannot make it to our rendez-vous
You can order a home alone kit so you don’t have to move

Leifur James,Mumma Don't Tell - Faltydl Remix,1182774545,"[Verse 1]
Hey, lady, you, lady
Cursing at your life
You're a discontented mother
And a regimented wife
I've no doubt you dream about
The things you'll never do
But I wish someone had talked to me
Like I wanna talk of you

[Verse 2]
Ooo, I've been to Georgia
And California
And anywhere I could run
Took the hand of a preacher man
And we made love in the sun
But I ran out of places and friendly faces
Because I had to be free

[Chorus]
I've been to paradise
But I've never been to me

[Verse 3]
Please lady, please, lady
Don't just walk away
'Cause I have this need to tell you
Why I'm all alone today
I can see so much of me
Still living in your eyes
Won't you share a part
Of a weary heart
That has lived a million lives
[Verse 4]
Oh, I've been to Nice
And the isle of Greece
When I sipped champagne on a yacht
I moved like Harlow in Monte Carlo
And showed 'em what I've got
I've been undressed by kings
And I've seen some things
That a woman ain't supposed to see

[Chorus]
I've been to paradise
But I've never been to me

[Spoken Verse 5]
Hey, you know what paradise is?
It's a lie
A fantasy we created about people and places
As we'd like them to be
But you know what truth is?
It's that little baby you're holding
And it's that man you fought with this morning
The same one you're going to make love with tonight
That's truth, that's love

[Verse 6]
Sometimes I've been to crying
For unborn children
That might have made me complete
But I, I took the sweet life I never knew
I'd be bitter from the sweet
I've spent my life exploring
The subtle whoring
That costs too much to be free
[Chorus]
Hey lady, I've been to paradise
But I've never been to me
I've been to paradise
Never been to me

[Outro]
I've been to Georgia and California
And anywhere I could run
I've been to paradise
Never been to me
Been to Nice and the isle of Greece
When I've sipped champagne on a yacht
I've been to paradise
Never been to me"

Multi-love
Checked into my heart and trashed it like a hotel room
Who is your God, where is she?
She wants to bury me in Austin under Uchiko
She don't want to be your man or woman
She wants to be your love

All of the other stalker daughters dragged her under
May all her minds be made up
I'll be her Vicodin, expired and escaped to Valhalla
She don't want to be your man or woman

Multi-love's got me on my knee
We were one, then become three
Mama, what have you done to me?
I'm half crazy

It's not that this song's about her
All songs are about her
The sun shines underneath us
Fearing new kinds of mind control and just blaming each other

Blue tits, right wing sex tips
Quick pull it out the bin Alice, let’s sell it
Ebay it, rough bars, mixing tunes
We be purple polo lards, broke down on snake pass
You cunt make it up, we be fat ass fat men, Starbucks anthem
Subway, we’re gonna take you down in the subway at midnight
Two shot mocha, wee wee spliff, dogger on the look out
Quick, bang it down, the motorway is our kin kingdom man

Profanity, fighting off the comedy working class
Its no longer 1979 you...
Photos of Bowies low won’t get you a coat like Neil Kinnock’s
Oh really? Humanist as opposed to your shop floor representatives
Oh no, dirty overall creased machine, I did a Thatcher
I got myself on a business scheme L-T-D
Now look at me comrade, I’m always fucking home for tea
No grovel, punch the card four week notice, notice me
Pissed out me head, key to the city

I’ll let him go, soul crushed, final warning
Trying to keep a brave face whilst his nose was runnin’
Should of trained him properly
If ya don’t take to it you get thrown off the lorry
Dusty trail, rusty rockets won’t stop it
His palace ain’t libel, Hugo Boss took it off, so what?
A celeb do will not justify you, end of no flash articles
No Flash Harry, no flash articles, I know people care
We all fucking care, but care don’t dare it even scratch the surface
It don’t even acknowledge small bumps smooth surface

We love to talk about how you'll come up to visit me

Raised in a town where it looked so good outside
Like it ain't that serious

[Verse 1: Kendrick Lamar]
Uh, and when I wake up
I recognize you're looking at me for the pay cut
But homicide be looking at you from the face down
What MAC-11 even boom with the bass down?
Schemin', and let me tell you 'bout my life
Painkillers only put me in the twilight
Where pretty pussy and Benjamin is the highlight
Now tell my momma I love her, but this what I like, Lord knows
Twenty of 'em in my Chevy, tell 'em all to come and get me
Reaping everything I sow, so my karma coming heavy
No preliminary hearings on my record
I'm a motherfucking gangster in silence for the record, uh
Tell the world I know it's too late
Boys and girls, I think I've gone cray
Drown inside my vices all day
Won't you please believe when I say

[Pre-Chorus: Kendrick Lamar]
Wouldn't you know
We been hurt, been down before
Nigga, when our pride was low
Lookin' at the world like, ""Where do we go?""
Nigga, and we hate po-po
Wanna kill us dead in the street fo sho'
Nigga, I'm at the preacher's door
My knees gettin' weak, and my gun might blow
But we gon' be alright

Nigga, we gon' be alright

[Verse 2: Kendrick Lamar]
What you want you, a house⁠? You, a car?
40 acres and a mule? A piano, a guitar?
Anything, see my name is Lucy, I'm your dog
Motherfucker, you can live at the mall
I can see the evil, I can tell it, I know it's illegal
I don't think about it, I deposit every other zero
Thinking of my partner, put the candy, paint it on the Regal
Digging in my pocket, ain't a profit big enough to feed you
Every day my logic get another dollar just to keep you
In the presence of your chico... Ah!
I don't talk about it, be about it, every day I sequel
If I got it then you know you got it, Heaven, I can reach you
Pat Dawg, Pat Dawg, Pat Dawg, my dog, that's all
Bick back and Chad, I trap the bag for y'all
I rap, I black on track so rest assured
My rights, my wrongs; I write 'til I'm right with God

[Outro: Kendrick Lamar & Thundercat]
I keep my head up high
I cross my heart and hope to die
Lovin' me is complicated
Too afraid of a lot of changes
I'm alright, and you're a favorite
Dark nights in my prayers

[Poem: Kendrick Lamar]
I remembered you was conflicted
Misusing your influence, sometimes I did the same
Abusing my power, full of resentment
Resentment that turned into a deep depression
Found myself screamin' in the hotel room
I didn't wanna self-destruct
The evils of Lucy was all around me
So I went runnin' for answers"
Kavinsky,Odd Look,1182774545,"[Chorus]
Your hesitation speaks to me louder than million words per minute

I freed a couple of souls, just yesterday, oh yeah

Uh, I had a good girl in my room, no tats on her skin
I put work all in her purse, she got guilt all in her grin
And I swear it be the same, every fuckin' where that I been
All you girls try to be saints, I’ll make you roll with a sinner
You can come to my hotel, you can bring me a friend
You can dress up like twins, I can teach you some French
Paper planes full of kush, a couple cups full of gin
Don't know what city I'm in, wake up and do it again
And if you know me well, you know I don't like to talk
But when I make a move, you know it's loud as fuck
And if you wanna scream, get loud as fuck, baby
I can tell you've earned a bit of deconstruction
A little bit, a little bit, ooh yeah, ooh Lord

[Chorus]
Your hesitation speaks to me louder than million words per minute

Said, said nothing will ever be... ever be the same, when you're finished
I freed a couple of souls, just yesterday, oh-oh, baby, ooh
[Bridge]
Do you feel like you'll come back around?
Does it make you strong?
Do you feel like you can take the planet on? Oh girl
Did I seem to give you a little bit more love?
To your gloomy life, to your empty life, uh
Little life, little lie, oh yeah
Do you feel like you got your money's worth?
'Cause if you did this round's on me
Just promise that you'll come back to me
Feed me, baby, feed me, baby

[Chorus]
Your hesitation speaks to me louder than million words per minute
I was born to this life you're living, in this game, baby, ooh
Said nothing will ever be... ever be the same, when you're finished
I freed a couple of souls, just yesterday, baby, ooh-ooh"

Nick Wiz, turn my headphones up, man
Uh, uh

Ayo, if you miss Hip-Hop, then stand up
Reminisce when this drop, get amped up
Any hit that's this hot is an anthem
Do ya' dance, love, she need a hand, breh
Lyricist that spit pop get stamped up
Hit or miss, then flip-flop, them clam up
They fearing this to hit blocks and slam clubs
Put yo' hands up, here ya' man come

[Verse 1]
Its mister word renowned with the best verse
One of the illest the streets, from the east to the west, heard
Get greeted with ghetto gestures like ""yessir""
A pre-meditated killer for the way I stretch words
Some of us love to flow 'til the club close
And some in love with blow for the love of dough
In it for fortune and fame, flamboyant for gurls
They extorting the game, exploiting the hood
Rappers ride for bread while the gossip spread
It's only hot cause we ride, spotted cops with feds
Plus, lots of heads go Pop instead
That's the word on the block is, ""Hip-Hop Is Dead""
So consumers quit copping, rappers flip-flopping
Artist pimped by they labels like a slave pick cotton
Pop Charts killing underground Hip-Hopers
While the world still looking for Ra like Bin Laden, let's go

Me and my dude's the new cool in the game
That Old-School feel with the New-School slang
The boomerang with the true duke flame
Shoot through yo' brain like smoking poom-shoong-pang
Ghetto galactic, the next level and back shit
Something like heroine, crack, mixed
The combination of Mike and Lebron, the life of a don
Yeah, just give the God the mic and it's on
My brand new vision gives you aneurisms
My fans'll listen, see my words like its camera's in 'em
We just anxious to bust like a new fo'-pound
So, the hood is reacquainted to the New York sound
Every verse is a mountain of proof, a man of my words
Even on the curb when I'm out of the booth
My style's the truth, unlimited amounts to produce
And my flow still tight when I'm about to get loose, let's go

The boogey-down, the buck-town mic flavor
I'm in yo' hoods like neighbors
Operation shut down, 0-60 like ""later""
It's rider, up-town, high-top, nike lacer
In the gut of the beast where they don't dwell
The gut of the streets but they don't sell
I still hold mics and stay so real
My flow tight with mo' sight's than AOL
I change climates like a plane pilot
Cause hurricanes and rain violent
Crack yo' skull, snatch yo' brain out it, uou out ya' mind if it ain't talent
And keep it out yo' rhymes if you ain't bought it
Raps tsunami, the track's behind me
Cats that try me, the raps too grimey

Mira que eres bonita, uh que guapa eres
Eres la más bonita de todas las mujeres
Con ojos de mar, pelo de fuego
Color piel canela y de aliento tierno
Mira que eres linda, vientre de azaleas
Campo de amapolas, risa de jazmín en primavera
Brote de trigo que me hace vibrar
De la cabeza a los pies, 24/7 todo el mes
Quiero gritar, si, quiero gritar
Quiero que me escuche entera toda la ciudad
Porque deseo montarte, engrasando cada pieza
Durmiendo cada parte, eterna como atenas eres
Selene, que me hiciste, que me das
Porque brilla tanto la ciudad
Creo que se me ha subido el corazón a la cabeza
Y no logro pensar con claridad
Porque:

Tú eres lo más bonito del mundo
Lo más bonito del mundo eres tú
Eres lo más bonito del mundo
Lo más bonito del mundo eres tú
Eres lo más bonito del mundo
Lo más bonito del mundo eres tú
Eres lo más bonito, lo más bonito del mundo

Y curiosamente hasta ahora no lo había visto tan claro
Tú abriste las ventanas de par en par
Hiciste que los días no pasaran en vano
Plantaste sandías por navidad
Conseguiste que el invierno me supiera a verano
Hiciste que brotaran de la noche a la mañana
Violetas y mimosas con solo una palmada
Y entonces lo vi claro, sí
No todas las verduras combinan con pescado
Y guardamos la bandera en la nevera
Y nos fuimos de la mano a cruzar la tierra
Y comimos sushi, y comimos cuscús
Y comimos ceviche, y bebimos limoncello
Tú alejaste a los monstruos de mi almohada
El día que dijiste que sí con la mirada

Tú eres lo más bonito del mundo
Lo más bonito del mundo eres tú
Eres lo más bonito del mundo
Lo más bonito del mundo eres tú
Eres lo más bonito del mundo

La chispa que me saca de mi estado inamovible
Tu eres más hermosa que el Col du Palier
Eres más majetuosa que el Tourmalet
Tienes mas curvas que Alpe d'Huez
Y me elevas más alto que el Galibier
Ya sabes que me gusta tanto el ciclismo
Y se que a ti estos nombres te suenan a chino
Ella son mis montañas, son mis catedrales
El lugar donde este hombre negocia con sus males
Y tu estas allí en cada pedaleo
En cada paella
En cada repecho
En cada diente de mi plato pequeño, y de piñón grande
De este globero
Se que tu no me entiendes, no me entiendes de nuevo
Esto es cantar te quiero en un idioma nuevo
Pata ti

Give, always give what you can
Even if your allies draw lines in the sand
And dig, always dig a little deeper
Sometimes it’s hard to be my brother’s keeper
Love. So you let love in
Baby, I am home in the wake of your skin, and it’s crazy
How we wear our ceremony
Always be open to your path and your journey
Yes, she cradles my loneliness
A home that I forage, nest
Universal test, feel the weight of my love
Put your hand on my chest
And rest, in the cradle of my arms
The battle that we face is the place where our scars come from
And to pick up the gun
My love, we are destined to teach these ones to be brave
And never run away
Courage is birthed from the womb on the first light of day
Yeah, the day you were born, you came out perfect
Never meant to be torn
In silence, never been so loud in the violence
Never been so proud of a people
When we’re fighting for a change
Not afraid to lose it all despite all the rage
We are animals
And we cannot be caged
Provoke us to fight
So we burn a little sage and write poetry
Wiser than the enemy will ever be
The minority
And authority
Are you here to protect or arrest me?
I can’t tolerate the hate, and I'm losing sleep
Can’t breathe, cause they’re choking out a war in me
Immorality

[Chorus]
Love letters to God
Wonder if she reads them or if they get lost
In the stars, the stars, in the stars
So many parts to a heavy heart
If there’s no beginning, then where would you start?
Start, start, where would you start?

[Verse 2]
Human souls, so we carve 'em into story Totem poles
Because we’re always searching for a certain goal
A pattern of physics, a role
Don’t believe all you’re told
And open
Open up your fist
A misconception, you can fight like this
In praise, with the power of prayer
If God’s on our side, we can take the stairs
To the heavens
Flipping through my chapter seven
I live with the snakes in the great deception
No court, in this country for men
Who steal from their mother on paper with pen
And we’re tripping
Down a red dirt road
And we’re asking
Is this the way we should go?
Kissing, soft top feet of my goddess
We walk the earth, baby, yeah we got this
Focus, and it’s redirected
Grateful, and I’m resurrected
Stubborn, but I know the way
You’re the skin of my drum
To your rhythm I will sway
Take my hand
I won’t lead you astray
We will not go gently into the darkest of days
Grandma’s here, and she says persevere
Take a walk in her moccs, taste the trail of tears
And our fears, are the same as they ever were
Beers, numb the pain of a holocaust
Gears, always mobbing in motion
Maybe, baby, be an island or an ocean
Your arches, how they bend and contract on my conscience
Never slipped through the grip of my thesis
And my theory is I shine in your presence
A deliverance

[Chorus]
Love letters to God
Wonder if she reads them or if they get lost
In the stars, the stars, in the stars
So many parts to a heavy heart
If there’s no beginning, then where would you start?
Start, start, where would you start?"

Steve ´n´ Seagulls,The Trooper,1183037273,"[Verse 1]
You'll take my life but I'll take yours too
You'll fire your musket but I'll run you through
So when you're waiting for the next attack
You'd better stand there's no turning back
The bugle sounds, the charge begins
But on this battlefield no one wins
The smell of acrid smoke and horse's breath
As I plunge on into certain death

[Refrain]
Oh oh oh oh oh oh oh oh oh
Oh oh oh oh oh oh oh oh oh

[Verse 2]
The horse he sweats with fear we break to run
The mighty roar of the Russian guns
And as we race towards the human wall
The screams of pain as my comrades fall
We hurdle bodies that lay on the ground
And the Russians fire another round
We get so near yet so far away
We won't live to fight another day

[Refrain]
Oh oh oh oh oh oh oh oh oh
Oh oh oh oh oh oh oh oh oh
[Guitar solo]

[Verse 3]
We get so close, near enough to fight
When a Russian gets me in his sights
He pulls the trigger and I feel the blow
A burst of rounds takes my horse below
And as I lay there gazing at the sky
My body's numb and my throat is dry
And as I lay forgotten and alone
Without a tear I draw my parting groan

[Refrain]
Oh oh oh oh oh oh oh oh oh
Oh oh oh oh oh oh oh oh oh"

Twenty-four seven, three sixty-five, pussy stays on my mind

Split and go where? Back to wearing knockoffs?
Haha, knock it off, Neimans, shop it off
Let's talk over mai tais, waitress, top it off
Hoes like vultures, wanna fly in your Freddy loafers
You can't blame 'em, they ain't never seen Versace sofas
Every bag, every blouse, every bracelet
Comes with a price tag, baby, face it
You should leave if you can't accept the basics
Plenty hoes in the baller-nigga matrix
Invisibly set, the Rolex is faceless
I'm just young, rich, and tasteless, P

[Verse 3: Kanye West]
Never was much of a romantic
I could never take the intimacy
And I know I did damage
'Cause the look in your eyes is killing me
I guess you knew of that advantage
'Cause you could blame me for everything
And I don't know how I'ma manage
If one day, you just up and leave

Laugh now, cry later as you look at the sun
If you live by the sword, you’ll probably die by the gun
Laugh now, cry later, why you hanging your head?
Plenty of time to answer to the angel of death

[Verse 1: Block McCloud]
I'm the prince of darkness, reign over the kingdom of disaster
Rhythm get smashed, fucked, like the children of a pastor
Nigga, I'm bad luck, I'm misery, I'm your master
Making you hang it up, like folks living in Alaska
I'm radiant, summer blinded, by the sun divine Damian
In the front lines of Egypt, with the blood line of an alien
I'm so defiant, the stone that broke Goliath's dome
Flow tyrant, hold the belt of Orion, I strode with giants
The globetrotter, spit Goldschläger and molt' lava
The old father of flows, there's no one that goes harder
I'm the Al-Qaeda style writer, death's an inspirador
A life of behind these walls, get caught in my lines of fire
And expire, I'm the devil's pitchfork in the road
I'll torture your soul, 'til you sell it for a fortune of gold
The fortunes foretold, we all die, so live life to the fullest
Live by the gun, die by the bullet, by the knife slicing your gullet
Pharaoh

[Verse 2: Crypt the Warchild]
Too blind to see the light, I envision blackness
Live by the bloody hatchet, die from the dusty ratchet
Back from the lake of fire, with my halo broken
They want reality so I give 'em a fatal dosage
Niggas acting real savage, but I barely notice
I'm headhunting, so I ain't trying to lose my focus
We the murderers, murderous, call the coroners
Tell them to stop recording us...
No more hope in 'em, box cutter open 'em
This is uncut opium, for you to put your nose up in
Got em overdosing, head-swelling, comatosing
Overseas, so I'm posting bodies floating in the ocean

So spare your words before you get embarrassed nerd
Waiting for the day I'm catching you
You can have MMA fighters protecting you, pussy I'm still wrecking you
Your idol, the one you wish you could perform like
Drop classic albums, you can't even get one song right
A couple songs tight, but not cause you speaking on 'em
It's cause the beat was banging and had dope features on it
It's Reefer on it, you got a rat's spine, a chicken's heart
And a weasel's stomach, what are you?
You little hog you, you fucking pig
I split your wig, so what you on kid?
Dope or dog food?
This ain't a warning, this a promise boy
Cause I'm your motherfucking daddy, and I won't raise a mama's boy

You done put two of America's most wanted
In the same motherfuckin' place at the same motherfuckin' time?
(Ain't nothin' but a gangsta party)
Ha, ha, ha, ha, y'all niggas about to feel this
(Ain't nothin' but a gangsta party)
Break out the champagne glasses and the motherfuckin' condoms
Have one on us, a'ight?
(Ain't nothin' but a gangsta party)
A toast to the gangsters

[Verse 1: 2Pac]
Picture perfect, I paint a perfect picture
Bomb the hoochies with precision, my intention's to get richer
With the S-N double-O-P, Dogg, my fuckin' homie
You's a cold-ass nigga on them hogs

[Verse 2: Snoop Doggy Dogg]
Sure 'nough, I keep my hand on my gun
'Cause they got me on the run
Now I'm back in the courtroom, waitin' on the outcome
""Free 2Pac"" is all that's on a nigga's mind
But at the same time, it seems they tryin' to take mine
So I'ma get smart and get defensive and shit
And put together a Million March for some gangsta shit
[Verse 3: 2Pac]
So now they got us laced
Two multi-millionaire motherfuckers catchin' cases
Bitches get ready for the throw down, the shit's about to go down
Me and Snoop about to clown
I'm losin' my religion, I'm vicious on these stool pigeons
You might be deep in this game, but you got the rules missin'
Niggas be actin' like they savage, they out to get the cabbage
I've got nothin' but love for my niggas livin' lavish

[Verse 4: Snoop Doggy Dogg]
I've got a pit named Petey, she Nigerina
I've got a house out in the hills right next to Chino
And I think I've got a black Bimmer
But my dream is to own a fly casino
Like Bugsy Siegel, and do it all legal
And get scooped up by the little homie in the Regal
It feels good to you, baby-bubba
You see, this is for the G's and the keys, motherfucker

[Verse 5: 2Pac]
Now follow as we ride
Motherfuck the rest, two of the best from the Westside
And I can make you famous
Niggas been dyin' for years, so how can they blame us?

I never stop bailin' these motherfuckin' G's
If you got it, better flaunt it

Now give me fifty feet
Defeat is not my destiny, release me to the streets
And keep whatever's left of me
Jealousy is misery, sufferin' is greed
Better be prepared when you cowards fuck with me
I bust and flee
These niggas must be crazy, what?
There ain't no mercy motherfuckers who can fade the thugs
You thought it was, but it wasn't, now disappear
Bow down in the presence of a boss player

[Verse 7: Snoop Doggy Dogg]
It's like, Cuh, Blood, gang-bangin'
Everybody in the party doin' dope-slangin'
You gotta have paper in this world
You might get your first snatch before your eyes swirl
You doin' your job every day
And then you work so hard 'til your hair turn gray
Let me tell you 'bout life and 'bout the way it is
You see, we live by the gun, so we die by the guns, kid
[Verse 8: 2Pac]
They tell me not to roll with my Glock
So now I got a throw-away
Floatin' in the black Benz (Bitch), tryin' to do a show a day
They wonder how I live with five shots
Niggas is hard to kill on my block
Schemes for currency and dough-related
Affiliated with the hustlers and so we made it
No answers to questions, I'm tryin' to get up on it
My nigga, Dogg, and me, eternally the most wanted

Oh oh l'amor oh oh fa calor oh oh

S'aparten els núvols

Et tapes la cara
Del tot sospitós
A dalt hi ha un sostre
Enorme i preciós

Oh oh l'amor oh oh fa calor oh oh
Oh oh l'amor oh oh fa calor oh oh

Tot el que toques
Es torna foc
Enmig les flames
Explota el cor

Agafes aire
T'agafes fort
Amb quines ganes
Surt volant tot

El nom de les coses
El vull triar jo
A partir d'ara

Això no és cap broma
És la febre de l'or
Destries la sorra
I et quedes lo bo

L'amor fa calor oh oh (oh oh)
Oh oh l'amor oh oh fa calor oh oh

The Beatles,Lucy In The Sky With Diamonds - Remastered 2009,toni085,"[Verse 1]
Picture yourself in a boat on a river
With tangerine trees and marmalade skies
Somebody calls you, you answer quite slowly
A girl with kaleidoscope eyes

[Pre-Chorus 1]
Cellophane flowers of yellow and green
Towering over your head
Look for the girl with the sun in her eyes
And she's gone

[Chorus]
Lucy in the sky with diamonds
Lucy in the sky with diamonds
Lucy in the sky with diamonds
Ahh

[Verse 2]
Follow her down to a bridge by a fountain
Where rocking horse people eat marshmallow pies
Everyone smiles as you drift past the flowers
That grow so incredibly high

[Pre-Chorus 2]
Newspaper taxis appear on the shore
Waiting to take you away
Climb in the back with your head in the clouds
And you're gone

[Chorus]
Lucy in the sky with diamonds
Lucy in the sky with diamonds
Lucy in the sky with diamonds
Ahh

[Verse 3]
Picture yourself on a train in a station
With plasticine porters with looking glass ties
Suddenly, someone is there at the turnstile
The girl with kaleidoscope eyes

[Chorus]
Lucy in the sky with diamonds
Lucy in the sky with diamonds
Lucy in the sky with diamonds
Ahh

[Chorus]
Lucy in the sky with diamonds
Lucy in the sky with diamonds
Lucy in the sky with diamonds
Ahh

[Chorus]
Lucy in the sky with diamonds
Lucy in the sky with diamonds
Lucy in the sky with diamonds
Ahh"
Bukahara,Eyes Wide Shut - Live,1183037273,"[Verse 1]
You know it's hard to be the person that's waiting
I can't keep up, so I'll wait for you
And the way you act out, I can't explain it
Haven't slept for days and I'm blaming you

[Pre-Chorus]
And I don't mind the fighting or the secrets that you're hiding
I just can't go on denying no more
And do you know, do you know, do you know
That you're too far out to love? Too far out, girl

[Chorus]
Look what you do to me, oh
I'm tired of eyes wide shut
This crazy love, I can't fix it
I'm not wild enough for you
Look what you do to me, oh
I tired of eyes wide shut
This crazy love, I can't fix it
Quit crazy love, I can't fix it, no

[Post-Chorus]
You're too far out
Too far out to love

[Verse 2]
And there were times when I thought you were changing
Even though I tried, I can't change for you, I can't change for you
So I guess this love is through
It's not steady enough for me or ready enough for you

[Pre-Chorus]
'Cause I don't mind the fighting or the secrets that you're hiding
I just can't go on denying no more
And do you know, do you know, do you know
That you're too far out to love? Too far out, girl

[Chorus]
Look what you do to me, oh
I'm tired of eyes wide shut
This crazy love, I can't fix it
I'm not wild enough for you
Look what you do to me, oh
I tired of eyes wide shut
This crazy love, I can't fix it
Quit crazy love, I can't fix it, no

[Post-Chorus]
You're too far out

[Bridge]
You know it's hard to be the person that's waiting
I can't keep up, so I'll wait for you (oh, baby)

[Chorus]
Look what you do to me, oh
I'm tired of eyes wide shut
This crazy love, I can't fix it
I'm not wild enough for you
Look what you do to me, oh
I tired of eyes wide shut
This crazy love, I can't fix it
Quit crazy love, I can't fix it, no

[Post-Chorus]
You're too far out, no more
You're too far out
Too far out to love
You're too far out
Too far out to love"

John Williams,"Main Title And First Victim - From ""Jaws"" Soundtrack",copia002,"[Chorus]
How many brothers fell victim to the streets?
Rest in peace, young nigga, there's a heaven for a G
Be a lie If I told you that I never thought of death
My niggas, we the last ones left, but life goes on
How many brothers fell victim to the streets?
Rest in peace, young nigga, there's a heaven for a G
Be a lie If I told you that I never thought of death
My niggas, we the last ones left, but life goes on

[Verse 1]
As I bail through the empty halls, breath stinkin' in my jaws
Ring, ring, ring — quiet, y'all, incomin' call
Plus this my homie from high school, he gettin' by
It's time to bury another brother, nobody cry
Life as a baller: alcohol and booty calls
We used to do 'em as adolescents, do you recall?
Raised as G's, loc'ed out, and blazed the weed
Get on the roof, let's get smoked out, and blaze with me
Two in the morning and we still high, assed out
Screamin', ""Thug 'til I die!"" before I passed out
But now that you're gone, I'm in the zone
Thinkin' I don't wanna die all alone, but now you gone
And all I got left are stinkin' memories
I love them niggas to death, I'm drinkin' Hennessy
While tryin' to make it last
I drank a fifth for that ass when you passed, 'cause life goes on

[Chorus]
How many brothers fell victim to the streets?
Rest in peace, young nigga, there's a heaven for a G
Be a lie If I told you that I never thought of death
My niggas, we the last ones left, but life goes on
How many brothers fell victim to the streets?
Rest in peace, young nigga, there's a heaven for a G
Be a lie If I told you that I never thought of death
My niggas, we the last ones left, and life goes on

[Verse 2]
Yeah nigga, I got the word it's hell
You blew trial and the judge gave you 25 with an L
Time to prepare to do fed time, won't see parole
Imagine life as a convict that's gettin' old
Plus with the drama, we're lookin' out for your baby's mama
Takin' risks, while keepin' cheap tricks from gettin' on her
Life in the hood is all good for nobody
Remember gamin' on dumb hotties at yo' party
Me and you, no truer two, while schemin' on hits
And gettin' tricks that maybe we can slide into
But now you buried — rest, nigga, 'cause I ain't worried
Eyes blurry, sayin' goodbye at the cemetery
Though memories fade
I got your name tatted on my arm
So we both ball 'til my dyin' days
Before I say goodbye
Kato and Mental, rest in peace! Thug 'til I die!

[Chorus]
How many brothers fell victim to the streets?
Rest in peace, young nigga, there's a heaven for a G
Be a lie If I told you that I never thought of death
My niggas, we the last ones left, but life goes on
How many brothers fell victim to the streets?
Rest in peace, young nigga, there's a heaven for a G
Be a lie If I told you that I never thought of death
My niggas, we the last ones left, 'cause life goes on

[Verse 3]
Bury me smilin' with G's in my pocket
Have a party at my funeral, let every rapper rock it
Let the hoes that I used to know
From way befo' kiss me from my head to my toe
Give me a paper and a pen, so I can write about my life of sin
A couple bottles of gin, in case I don't get in
Tell all my people I'm a Ridah
Nobody cries when we die, we Outlawz, let me ride
Until I get free
I live my life in the fast lane, got police chasin' me
To my niggas from old blocks, from old crews
Niggas that guided me through back in the old school
Pour out some liquor, have a toast for the homies
See, we both gotta die, but you chose to go before me
And brothers miss you while you gone
You left your nigga on his own; how long we mourn? Life goes on

[Chorus]
How many brothers fell victim to the streets?
Rest in peace, young nigga, there's a heaven for a G
Be a lie If I told you that I never thought of death
My niggas, we the last ones left, but life goes on
How many brothers fell victim to the streets?
Rest in peace, young nigga, there's a heaven for a G
Be a lie If I told you that I never thought of death
My niggas, we the last ones left, but life goes on

[Outro]
Life goes on, homie
Gone on, 'cause they passed away
Niggas doin' life
Niggas doin' 50 and 60 years and shit
I feel you, nigga, trust me, I feel you
You know what I mean?
Last year we poured out liquor for ya
This year, nigga, life goes on, we're gonna clock now
Get money, evade bitches, evade tricks
Give playa haters plenty of space
And basically just represent for you, baby
Next time you see your niggas, we gon' be on top, nigga
You gon' be like, ""Goddamn, them niggas came up!""
That's right, baby, life goes on
And we up out this bitch
Hey, Kato! Mental!
Y'all niggas make sure it's poppin'
When we get up there, man, don't front
Life goes on
Hold me no more, hold me no more
Yes it do, yes it do, yes it do"

Se me enamora

Se me enciende la luna cuando me miras

Entre risas y llanto la vida se ha ido

Tu viviendo con alguien que nunca has querido

Tu sonrisa y la mía se las llevo el rió
Tu mirada y la mía se hicieron gaviotas
Y volaron al aire

Se me enamora el alma

Vigilando mi casa mañana y tarde

You never running from this town

Kinda think you said
You'll never get anything better than this

'Cause you're going round in circles
And everyone knows you're trouble

Cause you read it in a big book
And now you giving me the look look
But just remember how we shook shook
And all the things we took took

This town's the oldest friend of mine

Get up and we get down
We're always running round this town

And to think I said
We'd never make anything better than this

'Cause we're always in small circles
And everyone thinks we're trouble

We didn't read it in the big book
And now we're giving you the look look
Just remember how we shook shook
And all the things we took took

[Intro]
Aaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaah

[Verse 1]
Auschwitz, the meaning of pain
The way that I want you to die
Slow death, immense decay
Showers that cleanse you of your life
Forced in like cattle
You run
Stripped of
Your life's worth
Human mice, for the angel of death
Four hundred thousand more to die

[Chorus 1]
Angel of death
Monarch to the kingdom of the dead

[Verse 2]
Sadistic, surgeon of demise
Sadist of the noblest blood
Destroying, without mercy
To benefit the Aryan race
Surgery, with no anesthesia
Feel the knife pierce you intensely
Inferior, no use to mankind
Strapped down, screaming out to die
[Chorus 2]
Angel of death
Monarch to the kingdom of the dead
Infamous butcher
Angel of death

[Verse 3]
Pumped with fluid, inside your brain
Pressure in your skull begins pushing through your eyes
Burning flesh drips away
Test of heat burns your skin, your mind starts to boil
Frigid cold cracks your limbs
How long can you last
In this frozen water burial?
Sewn together, joining heads
Just a matter of time
'Till you rip yourselves apart
Millions laid out in their
Crowded tombs
Sickening ways to achieve
The Holocaust

[Verse 4]
Seas of blood, bury life
Smell your death as it burns
Deep inside of you
Abacinate, eyes that bleed
Praying for the end of
Your wide awake nightmare
Wings of pain, reach out for you
His face of death staring down
Your blood's running cold
Injecting cells, dying eyes
Feeding on the screams of
The mutants he's creating
Pathetic harmless victims
Left to die
Rancid angel of death
Flying free
[Lead - King and Hanneman]

[Chorus 2]
Angel of death
Monarch to the kingdom of the dead
Infamous butcher
Angel of death
Angel of death"

[Verse 1]
As I flow, into the rhyme much smoother
I keep the pace and add bass for you to
Be able to experience the strength of God
On your tape with a break that I make to part
The weak-kneed hippie MC's and wannabes
From the Dog, so they can't see me
I'm movin' swifter with the gift to lift ya
I don't step light, I don't talk shit
You suckers are all in, to try is suicide
I roll with the flow 'cause I'm qualified
To keep the peace and teach y'all to get along
Build my rep and step to the song
From jazz to hip-hop, the Dog'll never stop
Get busy to the melodies that I concoct
When the raps are spit the grits stack like bricks
And you're please to receive P's hip-hop fix

[Interlude]
On the jazz tip
Smoother and smoother
And you don't stop

[Verse 2]
It's a mellow madness in the summer time
Females outside, enjoyin' the sunshine
Kickin' it live with the knob on ten
Good food and mood is the peace my friend
Much brotherhood because it's understood
That everyone in the sun is about the good
Lifestyle, and while some came to shine
Don't matter cause the other brothers know the time
I'm the P, D-O-G and I'm swift
Son of Shabazz, shooter of the gift
To keep y'all steppin' to the beat in real time
Mad on the mix complementin' the rhyme
With oh so smooth cuts flowin' like mercury
Keeps you suckers knowin' that you'll never be servin' me
I don't sleep and I do not sing
I drop math in your path cause I have to bring
You on a jazz tip
[Interlude]
Yeah
So smooth in the summer time
DJ Mad Mike y'all
(scratching)
Smooth

[Verse 3]
Birth is given to the knowledge when I recite
Smooth words that keep y'all hype
Not down with the meaningless babble that some spit
I'm paid to degrade that ignorant shit​
With the ""so proud, so strong"" message of the Nation
Can't be dropped or stopped, so don't come
With the intent to present a argument
I don't tolerate it, so don't act dumb
I'ma roll, over those who oppose
The speech when I teach y'all to reach your goal
Be strong and carry on and play the song
And listen to the lyrics and you'll never go wrong
As-salamu alaykum, brothers I'ma take 'em
Straight through the path that I'm makin'
And coexist in bliss peace and righteousness
So smooth on a jazzy tip like this

[Interlude]
Yeah
And you don't stop
Peace"

Favorite jeans on my rear

Bills to pay so hit that dirt

I was 15 minutes late
Because I tried to be great
Dancin' on my fate
Your opinion not today
They said ""What's it gonna take?""
I said ""I wanna bigger plate""
Told that lady pour my drink
Then I went up on my rate
I could see the bitch was fake
So like Chapo I escaped
And I told that ho no
Like my ex you got to go
I want all my money upfront

Let's stop being public
I guess we should get a room
Oh, I don't believe it
Yeah, I think I have a screw loose
I think you have a screw loose too

[Chorus]
So oooh
Because our lips are like glue
I think I love you
So oooh
Yeah, I wanna love you
I wanna love you for the night

[Verse 2]
Don't beat yourself up
It's something that I've done
It's something that we all go through
Let's finish up our drinks
We better make a move
'Cause we could carry on 'til two

[Pre-Chorus 2]
I know what you're thinking
I know that it's not like you
Your heartbeat is so quick
When you say, ""Let's rendez-vous""
Oh, I don't believe it
Yeah, I think I have a screw loose
I think you have a screw loose too

[Chorus]
So oooh
Because our lips are like glue
I think I love you
So oooh
Yeah, I wanna love you
I wanna love you for the night

[Post-Chorus]
So do you want to
Want to go (go, go)?
'Cause I want you
And you know (know, know)
So do you want to
Want to go (go, go)?
I want to love you

[Bridge]
I'm so ready to go home
So call us up a cab and stop me feeling lonely
Why don't you give me your number
It's time to call a cab, stop spending all your money

[Chorus]
So oooh
Because our lips are like glue
I think I love you
So oooh
Yeah, I wanna love you
I wanna love you for the night

[Post-Chorus]
So do you want to
Want to go (go, go)?
'Cause I want you
And you know (know, know)
So do you want to
Want to go (go, go)?
I want to love you

[Outro]
Oooh
Oooh"
