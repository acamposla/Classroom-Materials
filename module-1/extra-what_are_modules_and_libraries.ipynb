    "As we advance on our coding skills and make more complex programs, instead of having all the code in a single file, which would make things a little chaotic, we should **modulate**, that is, separate different parts of our program in different blocks (modules), which usually mean they will be on different files and folders.\n",
    "\n",
    "It is essential for maintenance of a program, since it is a lot faster to locate bugs, errors and do improvements if we know where to look. Therefore, modules are usually separated by functionality.\n",
